logtoload

Takes an Apache log and turns it into:
	1. A list of URLs that were requested.
	2. An XML file that can be used in the JMeter load tester.

Quick run: ruby main.rb "log.log" "urls.txt" "load_test.xml"

The script takes four command-line arguments:

- filename for input log file (string, not nil)
- filename for url list (string, or nil to not write file)
- filename for load test xml (string, or nil to not write file)

Note that the script outputs twenty to thirty lines of XML per URL,
so you might want to limit the log files you feed in to a few hundred unique URLs.
